**Get By** was released in 2003 as the 3rd single off of Talib Kweli's **Quality**. The track was produced by **Kanye West** with heavy reliance on the **Nina Simone's Sinnerman** as a handful of his tracks did back then. It slaps .. hard.

I didn't start the remix out trying to create a beat for Kweli's lyrics, they jaut sat really nicely in the beat. The backbone of the beat is a sample from **Wes Montgomery's** cover of The Beatles' **A Day in the Life**.

## Introduction

Hello. My name is **Nikolai** and I like to make things.

Born in New Orleans to a piano player and a fine artist, I've spent each chapter of my life trying to make goods of the highest quality.

### Software

Over two decades ago, while on tour with a talented hip hop group named Northern State, I decided that I would fill my downtime with learning how to build websites. I figured I would learn enough to put together a website for myself and move on. I really enjoyed it. But I wanted some animation so I started to play around with flash. 

### Music

Growing up in Brooklyn during the 90s is the greatest gift I have ever been given. Growing up alongside hip hop in NYC left an indelible mark on my personality that can still be seen today. I was able to get my first turntables and mixer in a trade for a pair of rollerblades (yup) that I had been given as payment from the skate shop at which I helped out. The rig was pathetic but it was more than enough to kickstart my love affair for vinyl.

### Family

The most important thing I have ever done is become a father.
